# Diamond detector
A simple detector for diamonds, using two different approaches. One based on neural network, the other based on a simple image processing algorithm.

To run the detector based on image processing:
```bash
python detect_shapes.py -i dataset/N1_00051_Id0.jpg
```

To run the detector based on machine learning:
```bash
python recognize.py -i dataset/N1_00051_Id0.jpg 
```
